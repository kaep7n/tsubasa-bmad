## Mock Updates

### Updated GoalService Mock

mockGoalService.createGoal.and.returnValue(of({} as any));
mockGoalService.createOpponentGoal.and.returnValue(of({} as any));
```

## Test Coverage Details

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Description | Tests Added | Status |
|----|-------------|-------------|--------|
| AC 1 | Opponent Goal button visible on scorer screen | 6 | ✅ Complete |
| AC 2 | Creates OpponentGoalFormData | 11 | ✅ Complete |
| AC 3 | Includes game_id, minute, timestamp | 11 | ✅ Complete |
| AC 5 | Toast notification "Opponent Goal - [Minute]'" | 9 | ✅ Complete |
| AC 9 | Uses existing GoalService infrastructure | 8 | ✅ Complete |

### Feature Coverage

1. **Button Rendering**: Complete coverage of button visibility, styling, icons, and accessibility
2. **Data Creation**: Comprehensive testing of OpponentGoalFormData structure and values
3. **Service Integration**: Full integration with GoalService, GameTimerService, MatSnackBar, MatDialogRef
4. **Error Handling**: Extensive error scenario coverage
5. **Edge Cases**: Robust edge case handling including rapid clicks, extreme values, and concurrent operations
6. **Undo Functionality**: Basic undo subscription testing

## Test Quality Metrics

### Test Organization
- **Well-structured**: 8 distinct describe blocks
- **Clear naming**: All tests follow "should [action] [expected result]" pattern
- **Isolated**: Each test is independent and uses proper beforeEach setup
- **Async handling**: Proper use of async/await throughout

### Code Coverage Areas
- Component method: `onOpponentGoalClick()`
- Template: `.opponent-goal-button` element
- Service integration: `GoalService.createOpponentGoal()`
- UI feedback: Toast notifications
- Modal behavior: Dialog closure with flags

### Test Patterns Used
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
- **Mock verification**: Service call verification
- **State assertions**: Component signal state checks
- **Integration testing**: Multi-service coordination
- **Edge case coverage**: Boundary and error scenarios

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests for this component
npm test -- --include="**/goal-log-modal.component.spec.ts"

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- --include="**/goal-log-modal.component.spec.ts" --grep="Opponent Goal Tracking"
```

## Files Modified
