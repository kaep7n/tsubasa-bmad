## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Tsubasa**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a new Progressive Web Application built from scratch with Angular 17+ and Supabase. No starter templates are being used.

## 2. High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

Tsubasa is built as a **Jamstack-style Progressive Web Application** with an **offline-first, mobile-first architecture**. The frontend uses **Angular 17+** with Service Workers for offline capability, while the backend leverages **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime) as a Backend-as-a-Service. The application is deployed to **Cloudflare Pages** with global CDN distribution, ensuring fast load times for coaches accessing the app from remote field locations.

The architecture prioritizes **speed and reliability** over feature complexity. Direct RESTful API communication between Angular services and Supabase provides simplicity while Service Workers with IndexedDB enable full offline functionalityâ€”critical since many youth football fields lack reliable internet connectivity. Authentication uses Supabase Auth with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring complete data isolation between coaches. The PWA approach eliminates app store friction while maintaining a native-like experience through "Add to Home Screen" installation.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Cloudflare Pages + Supabase
**Key Services:**
- **Frontend Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (global CDN, automatic HTTPS)
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL (with Row-Level Security)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (email/password, JWT sessions)
- **Realtime (future):** Supabase Realtime subscriptions (v2 collaboration features)
- **Storage (future):** Supabase Storage (v2 photo uploads, exports)

**Deployment Host and Regions:**
- Cloudflare Pages: Global edge network (200+ cities)
- Supabase: Hosted in US East (free tier) or EU Central (compliance option)

### Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monolithic Single Application
**Monorepo Tool:** Not applicable (single Angular app in v1)
**Package Organization:** Standard Angular CLI structure with feature modules

### Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** Static site generation with API-based backend - _Rationale:_ PWA with static Angular build served from CDN achieves maximum performance and offline capability
- **Offline-First Pattern:** Service Worker intercepts all requests; IndexedDB as local-first data store - _Rationale:_ Remote field locations have unreliable connectivity
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase handles auth, database, and API generation - _Rationale:_ No custom backend code needed; accelerates MVP development
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Database-level access control via Supabase RLS policies - _Rationale:_ Each coach sees only their team data; security enforced at database layer
- **Component-Based UI:** Angular standalone components with reactive forms - _Rationale:_ Maintainability and reusability across feature modules
- **Repository Pattern (Data Layer):** Abstract Supabase API calls behind Angular services - _Rationale:_ Enables testing with mocks; provides migration path if backend changes
- **Optimistic UI Updates:** UI updates immediately, syncs in background - _Rationale:_ Essential for offline workflow; coaches see instant feedback
- **Queue-Based Sync:** Mutations queued during offline, replayed sequentially on reconnection - _Rationale:_ Maintains data consistency; handles partial failures gracefully
