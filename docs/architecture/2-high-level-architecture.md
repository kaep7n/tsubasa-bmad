# 2. High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

Tsubasa is built as a **Jamstack-style Progressive Web Application** with an **offline-first, mobile-first architecture**. The frontend uses **Angular 17+** with Service Workers for offline capability, while the backend leverages **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime) as a Backend-as-a-Service. The application is deployed to **Cloudflare Pages** with global CDN distribution, ensuring fast load times for coaches accessing the app from remote field locations.

The architecture prioritizes **speed and reliability** over feature complexity. Direct RESTful API communication between Angular services and Supabase provides simplicity while Service Workers with IndexedDB enable full offline functionalityâ€”critical since many youth football fields lack reliable internet connectivity. Authentication uses Supabase Auth with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring complete data isolation between coaches. The PWA approach eliminates app store friction while maintaining a native-like experience through "Add to Home Screen" installation.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Cloudflare Pages + Supabase
**Key Services:**
- **Frontend Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (global CDN, automatic HTTPS)
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL (with Row-Level Security)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (email/password, JWT sessions)
- **Realtime (future):** Supabase Realtime subscriptions (v2 collaboration features)
- **Storage (future):** Supabase Storage (v2 photo uploads, exports)

**Deployment Host and Regions:**
- Cloudflare Pages: Global edge network (200+ cities)
- Supabase: Hosted in US East (free tier) or EU Central (compliance option)

## Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monolithic Single Application
**Monorepo Tool:** Not applicable (single Angular app in v1)
**Package Organization:** Standard Angular CLI structure with feature modules

## Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** Static site generation with API-based backend - _Rationale:_ PWA with static Angular build served from CDN achieves maximum performance and offline capability
- **Offline-First Pattern:** Service Worker intercepts all requests; IndexedDB as local-first data store - _Rationale:_ Remote field locations have unreliable connectivity
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase handles auth, database, and API generation - _Rationale:_ No custom backend code needed; accelerates MVP development
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Database-level access control via Supabase RLS policies - _Rationale:_ Each coach sees only their team data; security enforced at database layer
- **Component-Based UI:** Angular standalone components with reactive forms - _Rationale:_ Maintainability and reusability across feature modules
- **Repository Pattern (Data Layer):** Abstract Supabase API calls behind Angular services - _Rationale:_ Enables testing with mocks; provides migration path if backend changes
- **Optimistic UI Updates:** UI updates immediately, syncs in background - _Rationale:_ Essential for offline workflow; coaches see instant feedback
- **Queue-Based Sync:** Mutations queued during offline, replayed sequentially on reconnection - _Rationale:_ Maintains data consistency; handles partial failures gracefully
