---

### Insights & Learnings

**Key realizations from the session:**

- **Speed is the only metric that matters for adoption**: If it's not faster than Excel + paper, it won't be used. Every UX decision must optimize for speed.

- **Youth context fundamentally changes design**: Unlike professional sports apps, this requires privacy-first, team-first, positive-reinforcement culture baked into every feature decision.

- **Offline isn't optional**: Remote fields with poor connectivity mean offline mode is a core requirement, not a nice-to-have.

- **Simplicity is harder than complexity**: The temptation to add "just one more field" must be resisted. Every optional field is friction. Minimal required data drives adoption.

- **Post-game coach energy is near zero**: Any post-game workflow must be optional and take <30 seconds, or it won't happen. Screenshot sharing solves this elegantly.

- **Defensive players need equal visibility**: Traditional stats favor scorers. Tracking defensive highlights levels the playing field and reinforces positive team culture.

- **The app must respect coaching time**: Coaches are watching kids, not phones. One-handed use, large targets, minimal taps, smart sorting all serve this principle.

- **Template-based recurring sessions are table stakes**: Manually creating 40+ training sessions per season is unrealistic. Templates with auto-generation are required for adoption.

- **Protected completed games prevent disaster**: Calendar sync is helpful until it overwrites tracked data. One-way sync with manual override is the only safe approach.

   - Design stat card layout (goals, assists, attendance, games played)
   - Implement team dashboard with collective stats
   - Ensure no leaderboard/ranking features
   - Test with varied player data (scorers, defenders, inconsistent attendance)
2. **Week 14**: Create screenshot-optimized post-game report
   - Design single-screen report layout
   - Include: final score, goal scorers with times, basic team stats
   - Optimize for mobile screenshot (readable text, good contrast)
   - Test screenshot quality on iOS and Android
3. **Week 15**: Add optional post-game reflection
   - Build simple form: overall feeling + 2 text fields
   - Make completely optional and skip-friendly
   - Store with game data for coach reference

**Resources needed:**
- Chart/graph library for future progress visualizations

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- **Role-playing technique** created authentic pain points and requirements from trainer perspective
- **"Yes, And..." building** generated momentum and prevented premature criticism of ideas
- **Convergent prioritization** at the end created clear MVP scope vs. future features
- **Technical stack alignment** (Angular, Supabase, Cloudflare) with constraints kept ideas grounded
- **Youth context awareness** throughout prevented building inappropriate features (leaderboards, data collection)

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Calendar import UX details**: How exactly does the refresh/change detection UI work? What if 20 games changed?
- **Offline sync conflict resolution**: What happens if coach tracks game offline on two devices?
- **Custom tag taxonomy**: How many custom tags before UI becomes cluttered? Need tag management system?
- **Multi-season data model**: How to archive old seasons while preserving historical player data?
- **Defensive highlight taxonomy**: Need more specific types? (1v1 won, aerial duel, tackle, interception, block, clearance)
- **Position tracking implementation**: Post-game quick assignment vs. more detailed positional data?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **User Story Mapping**: Organize MVP features into user journey flows (setup → training → game → review)
- **Prototyping**: Build clickable mockup of game tracking flow for user testing before development
- **Technical Architecture Workshop**: Deep dive on PWA offline sync, Supabase schema design, RLS policies
- **Competitor Analysis**: Research existing youth sports apps to identify gaps and opportunities

### Questions That Emerged
- How do other youth coaches currently track stats? Is Excel + paper universal or are some using apps?
- What's the typical youth football season structure? How many games/trainings per week/season?
- Are there legal/regulatory requirements for youth data storage we haven't considered?
- Should MVP include any opponent/league tracking, or is that v2?
- What's the business model? Free for coaches? Freemium? Club subscriptions?
- How important is cross-platform consistency (iOS Safari vs. Android Chrome)?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:**
  1. Technical architecture deep-dive (Supabase schema, RLS policies, offline sync strategy)
  2. UX prototyping session (Figma mockups of game tracking flow)
  3. Competitor analysis (what exists, what they do well/poorly)
- **Recommended timeframe:** Within 1-2 weeks while ideas are fresh
- **Preparation needed:**
  - Research existing youth sports tracking apps
  - Set up Supabase project and explore RLS capabilities
  - Draft initial data model for players, games, training sessions
