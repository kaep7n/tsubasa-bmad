# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

This PRD defines the MVP requirements for Tsubasa, a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help volunteer youth football coaches efficiently track player statistics, game events, and team performance.

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Speed**: Enable goal logging in <5 seconds, faster than handwriting on paper
2. **Offline-First**: Ensure full functionality without internet connectivity during games
3. **Simplicity**: Minimize cognitive load with smart defaults and 3-tap-max workflows
4. **Reliability**: Achieve 95%+ offline sync success rate with zero data loss
5. **Accessibility**: Support coaches aged 30-50 with varying technical proficiency
6. **Mobile-Optimized**: Deliver thumb-friendly UI for one-handed operation on touchscreens
7. **Privacy**: Protect youth player data with team-level isolation and secure authentication
8. **Scalability**: Support multiple seasons of data (100+ games) without performance degradation

## 1.2 Background Context

Volunteer youth football coaches (ages 30-50) manage teams of 15-20 players across training sessions and competitive games. Current solutions include:

- **Paper notebooks**: Fast but error-prone, no analytics, data entry burden
- **Spreadsheets**: Require manual data entry after games, slow during live tracking
- **Generic sports apps**: Complex interfaces designed for professional teams, require constant connectivity

**The Problem**: Coaches need to track goals, assists, attendance, and opponent scores during fast-paced games while standing on the sideline. Existing tools are either too slow (digital) or too limited (paper). The "faster than handwriting" requirement is the killer feature that differentiates Tsubasa.

**Target Users**: Volunteer coaches with smartphone access (iOS/Android), managing U8-U14 youth teams, needing quick statistics for league reporting and parent communication.

**Success Metrics**:
- 50+ active coaches within 6 months of launch
- <5 second average time to log a goal
- 95%+ offline sync success rate
- 4.5+ star rating on app stores
- 70%+ weekly active usage during season
