# 12. Next Steps

This PRD is now ready for development! Here are the recommended next steps:

## For UX/UI Design:
Review the UI Design Goals (Section 3) and create wireframes/mockups for the 10 core screens. Pay special attention to:
- Live game tracking interface (Stories 5.2-5.7) - this is the critical UX
- Goal logging modal with smart-sorted player list (Story 5.4)
- Statistics dashboards with charts (Stories 6.2-6.3)

## For Architecture Review:
Cross-reference this PRD with `docs/architecture.md` to ensure alignment on:
- Database schema definitions (verify all tables match)
- API patterns and RLS policies
- Offline sync strategy and conflict resolution
- Performance budgets and optimization targets

## For Development Team:
1. Start with **Epic 1** (Foundation & Authentication) to establish infrastructure
2. Proceed sequentially through epics (dependencies are ordered)
3. Each story is sized for 3-8 hours of focused development (suitable for AI agent execution)
4. Prioritize E2E tests for critical workflows: authentication, goal logging, offline sync
5. Target timeline: ~12-20 weeks with AI-assisted development

## For Product Manager:
1. Create epic files in `docs/prd/` for easier navigation (optional)
2. Set up project tracking (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira) with stories as tickets
3. Schedule design reviews for high-risk UX (live game tracking)
4. Plan user testing sessions with target coaches (post-Epic 5 completion)
