3. ✅ ESLint + Prettier configured with team rules
4. ✅ Git repository initialized with `.gitignore` for Angular
5. ✅ Monorepo structure created:
   - `/src` - Angular application
   - `/supabase` - Database migrations and functions
   - `/docs` - Architecture and PRD documents
6. ✅ Package.json scripts defined:
   - `npm start` - Development server
   - `npm test` - Unit tests with Karma
   - `npm run build` - Production build
   - `npm run lint` - ESLint check
7. ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.3+ installed and configured

## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Configuration
This story establishes the foundational technology stack for the Tsubasa project. All versions and technologies are defined in the DEFINITIVE tech stack specification.

**Frontend Core:**
- **Angular 17.3 LTS** - Component-based SPA framework with standalone components [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript 5.2+** - Type-safe JavaScript with strict mode enabled [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Angular CLI 17.3** - Development and build orchestration tooling [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**UI & Styling:**
- **Angular Material 17.3** - Material Design components optimized for mobile with large touch targets [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid prototyping [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Build & Development Tools:**
- **Webpack 5.x** - Module bundling (handled by Angular CLI) [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Code quality and formatting tools [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**State Management:**
- **RxJS 7.8** - Reactive state and async operations [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Angular Signals (17+)** - Simpler component state management [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure
The monorepo structure must follow the unified project structure specification:

```
tsubasa/
├── .github/workflows/       # CI/CD (future stories)
├── src/                     # Angular application
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── core/           # Singleton services & guards
│   │   ├── shared/         # Reusable components
│   │   └── features/       # Feature modules
│   ├── assets/             # PWA icons, manifest (future)
│   ├── environments/       # Config per environment
│   └── styles/             # Global styles
├── supabase/               # Database migrations (used in Story 1.2)
│   └── migrations/
├── tests/                  # E2E tests (future)
├── docs/                   # Documentation (already exists)
└── package.json
```
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

### Frontend Architecture Patterns
The Angular application follows a feature-based architecture with lazy loading:

**Core Module Structure:**
- `/core` - Singleton services and guards
- `/shared` - Reusable components across features
- `/features` - Feature modules (auth, dashboard, players, training, games, live-game, stats)
- `/layouts` - Layout components
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

**State Management Approach:**
- Use Signals for synchronous local state
- Use RxJS for async operations and service communication
- Service-based state management (no NgRx needed for single-user app)
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

### Coding Standards to Implement
All code must follow these critical naming conventions:

**Naming Conventions:**
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerListComponent`)
- Services: PascalCase + "Service" (e.g., `AuthService`)
- Database: snake_case (e.g., `team_id`)
- API Routes: kebab-case (e.g., `/api/team-players`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`)
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- Type Sharing: Define types in core/models, never duplicate
- API Calls: Always use service layer, never direct HTTP
- State Updates: Use Signals .update() or .set()
- Offline Queue: All mutations through OfflineSyncService (Story 1.7)
- Auth Checks: Use RLS policies, not application code
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]

### Project Structure Notes
- The `/docs` directory already exists with PRD and architecture documentation
- Ensure the monorepo structure aligns with the unified project structure specification
- The `/supabase/migrations/` directory will be used in Story 1.2 for database setup
- The `/tests` directory for E2E tests will be created in Story 1.3 (CI/CD setup)

### Backend Context
Although this story focuses on frontend scaffolding, note that the backend uses:
- **Supabase Backend-as-a-Service** - Auto-generated REST API from PostgreSQL schema
- **PostgreSQL 14+** - Database with ACID compliance
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Security at database level, not application level
[Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md, architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

## Dev Notes: Testing

### Testing Configuration for This Story
This story establishes the base testing infrastructure using Angular's default testing tools.

**Testing Framework:**
- **Jasmine 6.4** - Unit and component testing framework (Angular default)
- **Karma 6.2** - Test runner for unit tests
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
All future code must meet these minimum thresholds:
- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 75%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Pyramid for Tsubasa Project:**
- E2E Tests: 10%
- Integration Tests: 30%
- Unit Tests: 60%
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Setup for This Story:**
- Verify Karma configuration is present in `karma.conf.js`
- Ensure `ng test` command runs successfully
- Default Angular test setup is sufficient for this scaffolding story
- More comprehensive test configurations will be added in future stories

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: Co-located with source files as `.spec.ts` files
- E2E tests: `/tests` directory (to be created in Story 1.3)
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

**Key Test Areas (for future stories):**
- Offline sync scenarios
- RLS policy verification
- Game tracking workflows
- PWA functionality
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
