## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Dependencies:** This story requires both Story 1.1 and Story 1.2 to be completed:
- Story 1.1: Git repository initialized, package.json scripts configured (lint, test, build)
- Story 1.2: Supabase project setup with database migrations and pgTAP tests

### Deployment Architecture
This story implements the complete CI/CD pipeline for the Tsubasa project.

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Frontend:** Cloudflare Pages - Global CDN for fast worldwide delivery [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
- **Backend:** Supabase Cloud - Managed PostgreSQL (already configured in Story 1.2) [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions - Automated testing and deployment pipeline [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]

**Environment URLs:**
| Environment | Frontend URL | Backend URL |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Development | http://localhost:4200 | http://localhost:54321 |
| Staging | https://staging.tsubasa.pages.dev | https://staging-project.supabase.co |
| Production | https://tsubasa.app | https://prod-project.supabase.co |
[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]

**Cost Optimization:**
- MVP (50 coaches): $0/month (free tiers)
- Growth (500 coaches): $25/month
- Scale (5000 coaches): $125/month
[Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md]

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure
The CI workflow must run four jobs to ensure code quality and functionality.

**Workflow Configuration:**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build -- --configuration production

  database-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
      - run: supabase test db
        env:
          SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD }}
```

**Job Descriptions:**
1. **Lint Job**: Runs ESLint and Prettier to enforce code quality standards [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
2. **Test Job**: Runs Karma unit tests in headless Chrome [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
3. **Build Job**: Ensures production build succeeds
4. **Database Test Job**: Runs pgTAP tests against Supabase staging environment [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

### Cloudflare Pages Configuration
Cloudflare Pages provides automatic deployment from GitHub with global CDN distribution.

**Build Settings:**
- **Framework preset:** None (custom Angular build)
- **Build command:** `npm run build` (defined in package.json from Story 1.1)
- **Build output directory:** `dist/tsubasa/browser` (Angular 17 default output path)
- **Root directory:** `/` (monorepo root)

**Environment Variables Required:**
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```
These will be injected at build time for Angular environment configuration.

**Deployment Features:**
- **Automatic deployments:** Every push to `main` triggers production deployment
- **Preview deployments:** Every pull request gets unique preview URL
- **Global CDN:** Instant deployment to 200+ cities worldwide
- **HTTPS:** Automatic SSL/TLS certificates

### CI/CD Technology Stack
**Tools Used:**
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation platform [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Frontend hosting with global CDN
- **Supabase CLI** - For running database tests in CI [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Node.js 18+** - Runtime for build and test jobs [Source: architecture/13-development-workflow.md]

### GitHub Secrets Configuration
The following secrets need to be configured in GitHub repository settings:

**Required Secrets:**
1. `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Supabase personal access token for CLI authentication
2. `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` - Database password for running pgTAP tests

**How to add secrets:**
1. Go to GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add each secret name and value
4. Secrets are encrypted and only accessible by GitHub Actions

### Testing in CI/CD Pipeline
All testing strategies from the architecture must be automated.

**Test Execution in CI:**
1. **Unit Tests (Karma + Jasmine):**
   - Run in headless Chrome for CI compatibility
   - Must pass 80% coverage thresholds [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
   - Command: `npm test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless`

2. **Database Tests (pgTAP):**
   - Run against Supabase staging environment
   - Verify schema and RLS policies
   - Command: `supabase test db`
   [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

3. **Linting (ESLint + Prettier):**
   - Enforce coding standards
   - Must pass before merge
   - Command: `npm run lint`
   [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]

**Testing Pyramid (automated in CI):**
- E2E Tests: 10% (Story 1.3 uses Playwright - future implementation)
- Integration Tests: 30% (Database tests via pgTAP)
- Unit Tests: 60% (Karma + Jasmine)
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

### Project Structure Additions
This story adds CI/CD configuration files to the project:

```
tsubasa/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml                # GitHub Actions workflow
├── README.md                     # Updated with build badge
└── (rest of project structure from Stories 1.1 and 1.2)
```
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

### Performance Considerations
**Frontend Performance Requirements:**
- Bundle size < 250KB (initial) - verified in production build [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md]
- Lazy loading all features - Angular routing configured [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md]
- Service Worker caching - to be implemented in Story 1.7 [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md]

**Build Optimization:**
- Production build uses Angular CLI optimizations
- Tree-shaking and dead code elimination
- Minification and compression
- Source maps excluded from production

### Security Considerations
**Frontend Security:**
- CSP headers configured via Cloudflare Pages [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md]
- Angular's built-in XSS protection [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md]
- Environment variables for Supabase connection (not hardcoded)

**CI/CD Security:**
- GitHub secrets encrypted at rest
- Secrets only accessible by authorized workflows
- No sensitive data in logs
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is safe for public use (designed for client-side)

## Dev Notes: Testing

### Testing in CI/CD
This story automates the entire testing strategy defined in the architecture.

**Automated Test Execution:**
1. **Linting** - Code quality checks before any tests run
2. **Unit Tests** - Karma + Jasmine in headless Chrome [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
3. **Database Tests** - pgTAP schema and RLS policy validation [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
4. **Build Verification** - Production build must succeed

**Test Coverage Enforcement:**
The CI pipeline enforces minimum coverage requirements:
- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 75%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

**Headless Chrome for CI:**
Karma tests run in headless Chrome for CI compatibility:
```json
// karma.conf.js configuration for CI
browsers: ['ChromeHeadless'],
customLaunchers: {
  ChromeHeadlessCI: {
    base: 'ChromeHeadless',
    flags: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-gpu']
  }
}
```

**Database Testing in CI:**
- pgTAP tests run against Supabase staging environment
- Tests verify schema structure and RLS policies
- Must pass before deployment
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: Co-located with source files as `.spec.ts` files
- Database tests: `/supabase/tests/*.sql`
- E2E tests: `/tests` directory (future - Story will add Playwright)
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

**Key Test Areas (verified in CI):**
- RLS policy verification (pgTAP)
- Component unit tests (Karma)
- Service unit tests (Karma)
- Build integrity (production build)
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
