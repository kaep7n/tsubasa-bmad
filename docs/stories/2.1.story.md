# Story 2.1: Player Database Schema

## Status
Ready for Review

## Assigned To
James (Dev Agent)

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the player database schema created,
**so that** player data can be stored and queried

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Migration file created with `players` table:
   - `id` (uuid, primary key, default: gen_random_uuid())
   - `team_id` (uuid, foreign key to teams, not null)
   - `first_name` (text, not null)
   - `last_name` (text, not null)
   - `date_of_birth` (date, nullable)
   - `jersey_number` (int, nullable)
   - `photo_url` (text, nullable)
   - `squad` (text, nullable, e.g., "starters" or "substitutes")
   - `created_at` (timestamptz, default: now())
   - `updated_at` (timestamptz, default: now())
   - `deleted_at` (timestamptz, nullable for soft deletes)
2. ✅ RLS policies enabled on `players` table:
   - SELECT: Users can only see players from their team (`team_id = auth.jwt()->>'team_id'`)
   - INSERT: Users can only insert players to their team
   - UPDATE: Users can only update players from their team
   - DELETE: Users can only delete players from their team
3. ✅ Composite index created: `players(team_id, deleted_at)` for active player queries
4. ✅ Index created: `players(jersey_number)` for quick lookups
5. ✅ Trigger added: Update `updated_at` on row modification
6. ✅ Migration applied: `supabase db push`
7. ✅ TypeScript types generated: `supabase gen types typescript`
8. ✅ pgTAP tests verify schema constraints and RLS policies

  - [x] Run tests: `supabase test db`

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Dependency:** This story requires Story 1.2 (Supabase Project Setup) to be completed, as it creates the `teams` table that `players` references.

### Database Schema Design
The `players` table follows the architecture's data model specification with these key decisions:

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  date_of_birth DATE,
  jersey_number INTEGER CHECK (jersey_number >= 0 AND jersey_number <= 99),
  photo_url TEXT,
  squad TEXT CHECK (squad IN ('starters', 'substitutes')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md, architecture/9-database-schema.md]

**Soft Delete Pattern:**
- `deleted_at` field enables soft deletes (preserves historical data)
- All queries must filter: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` to exclude deleted players
- Allows "undo delete" functionality and preserves statistics
[Source: PRD Epic 2, Story 2.5 requirements]

**Squad Field:**
- Enum-like constraint allows only: `'starters'`, `'substitutes'`, or NULL
- Simple text field (no separate squad table for MVP)
- Future versions may normalize to a separate `squads` table
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
All RLS policies enforce team-level data isolation by checking `team_id`:

**Policy Examples:**
```sql
-- SELECT policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their team's players" ON players
  FOR SELECT USING (
    team_id IN (SELECT id FROM teams WHERE created_by = auth.uid())
  );

-- INSERT policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert players to their team" ON players
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    team_id IN (SELECT id FROM teams WHERE created_by = auth.uid())
  );
```
[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md, architecture/11-backend-architecture.md]

**Security Principle:** No application-level security checks needed - RLS handles all access control at the database level.
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md: "Auth Checks: Use RLS policies, not application code"]

### Performance Indexes
Three indexes optimize common query patterns:

1. **Composite Index (team_id, deleted_at):** Optimizes "get all active players for team" query
2. **Jersey Number Index:** Fast lookups for jersey number uniqueness checks
3. **Names Index:** Supports player search by first/last name

[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md: "Comprehensive indexes on foreign keys and commonly filtered columns"]

### Migration Naming Convention
Migration files use timestamp-based naming: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`

Example: `20250124120000_create_players_table.sql`

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#migrations: "Use timestamp-based naming"]

### TypeScript Type Generation
Supabase CLI auto-generates TypeScript interfaces from the database schema:

**Generated Type Location:** `src/app/models/supabase.types.ts`

**Custom Model Location:** `src/app/models/player.model.ts` (for business logic extensions)

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md: "SQL (PostgreSQL) - Database queries via Supabase"]

## Dev Notes: Testing

### pgTAP Testing Requirements
Database tests must verify:
1. Table schema matches specification
2. Constraints enforce data integrity (NOT NULL, CHECK, FK)
3. RLS policies block unauthorized access
4. Indexes exist for performance

**Test File Location:** `supabase/tests/players_table.test.sql`

**Example Test Structure:**
```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT plan(10);

-- Test table exists
SELECT has_table('public', 'players', 'players table should exist');

-- Test columns
SELECT has_column('public', 'players', 'id');
SELECT has_column('public', 'players', 'team_id');

-- Test RLS enabled
SELECT rls_enabled('public', 'players', 'RLS should be enabled');

-- Test policies exist
SELECT policy_exists('public', 'players', 'Users can view their team''s players');

SELECT * FROM finish();
ROLLBACK;
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all database tests
supabase test db

# Run specific test file
supabase test db players_table.test.sql
```
