# Story 2.2: Player List View

## Status
Ready

## Assigned To
James (Dev Agent)

## Story
**As a** coach,
**I want** to see a list of all my players,
**so that** I can quickly access player information

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ `PlayerListComponent` created with grid layout (2 columns on mobile, 3+ on tablet)
2. ✅ Each player card displays:
   - Photo (circular avatar) or initials if no photo
   - First name + Last name
   - Jersey number (top-right badge)
   - Quick stats preview: Goals this season, Attendance rate
3. ✅ Data fetched from Supabase on component init:
   - Query: `SELECT * FROM players WHERE team_id = {id} AND deleted_at IS NULL ORDER BY first_name ASC`
   - Cached to IndexedDB after fetch
4. ✅ Search bar at top:
   - Filters by first name or last name (case-insensitive)
   - Debounced input (300ms delay)
5. ✅ Filter dropdown:
   - "All Players" (default)
   - "Starters"
   - "Substitutes"
   - "No Squad Assigned"
6. ✅ Sort options (dropdown):
   - Alphabetical (A-Z)
   - Jersey Number (1-99)
   - Goals (Descending)
7. ✅ FAB: "Add Player" button (navigates to player creation form)
8. ✅ Empty state: "No players yet - tap + to add your first player"
9. ✅ Tap card: Navigate to player detail screen
10. ✅ Long-press card: Show quick actions (Edit, Delete)
11. ✅ Offline mode: Works from IndexedDB cache, shows sync status indicator
12. ✅ Pull-to-refresh: Re-fetches from Supabase
13. ✅ Loading state: Skeleton cards while data loads
14. ✅ Unit test: Verify filtering and sorting logic
15. ✅ E2E test: Navigate to player list, verify players displayed

## Dev Notes

### Component Structure
Component location: `/src/app/features/players/pages/player-list/player-list.component.ts`

**Template structure:**
- Top toolbar: Search bar + filter/sort dropdowns
- Main content: Grid of player cards
- FAB button: Fixed position for "Add Player"
[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md]

### State Management
Use Angular Signals for reactive state:
```typescript
readonly players = signal<Player[]>([]);
readonly filteredPlayers = computed(() => this.applyFilters(this.players()));
readonly searchTerm = signal<string>('');
readonly squadFilter = signal<string>('all');
```
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md: "State Updates: Use Signals .update() or .set()"]

### Offline-First Pattern
1. Check IndexedDB first for cached players
2. Fetch from Supabase in background
3. Update IndexedDB cache with fresh data
4. Use NetworkStatusService to detect online/offline
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

### Data Fetching
```typescript
getPlayers(): Observable<Player[]> {
  return this.supabase
    .from('players')
    .select('*')
    .eq('team_id', this.teamId)
    .is('deleted_at', null)
    .order('first_name', { ascending: true });
}
```
RLS automatically filters by team_id, but explicit filter improves query performance.

## Dev Notes: Testing

### Unit Test Requirements
**Test file:** `player-list.component.spec.ts`

Test cases:
- Players load and display correctly
- Search filters players by name
- Squad filter shows correct subset
- Sorting changes player order
- Empty state shows when no players
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

### E2E Test Requirements
**Test file:** `tests/e2e/player-management.spec.ts`

Flow:
1. Login as coach
2. Navigate to /players
3. Verify player list loads
4. Test search input
5. Tap player card → verify navigation
