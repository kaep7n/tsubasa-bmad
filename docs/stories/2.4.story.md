# Story 2.4: Edit Player Form

## Status
Ready

## Assigned To
James (Dev Agent)

## Story
**As a** coach,
**I want** to edit player details,
**so that** I can correct mistakes or update information

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ `EditPlayerComponent` created (reuses form from AddPlayerComponent)
2. ✅ Form pre-populated with existing player data on load
3. ✅ Photo handling:
   - Display current photo if exists
   - "Change Photo" button to upload new photo
   - "Remove Photo" button to delete photo (sets `photo_url = null`)
4. ✅ On submit:
   - Update player record in Supabase `players` table
   - Update IndexedDB (if offline, add to sync queue)
   - Set `updated_at = now()`
   - Navigate back to player detail screen
   - Show toast: "Player updated: {First Name} {Last Name}"
5. ✅ Photo replacement:
   - Upload new photo to Supabase Storage (overwrites old file)
   - Update `photo_url` in player record
6. ✅ Photo deletion:
   - Delete photo from Supabase Storage
   - Set `photo_url = null` in player record
7. ✅ Offline handling:
   - Form submission works offline
   - Photo operations queued for sync
   - Record updated in IndexedDB with `sync_state = 'pending'`
8. ✅ Conflict resolution:
   - If player was updated by another device, show warning
   - Offer options: "Keep my changes" | "Use server version" | "Merge manually"
9. ✅ Cancel button: Navigate back without saving (with confirmation if form dirty)
10. ✅ Unit test: Verify update logic and conflict resolution
11. ✅ E2E test: Edit player, verify changes saved

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Setup Edit Mode in PlayerFormComponent** (AC: 1, 2)

- [x] **Task 8: Cancel Button** (AC: 9)
  - [x] Add cancel button
  - [x] Check if form dirty
  - [x] Show confirmation if changes exist
  - [x] Navigate back to player detail

- [x] **Task 9: Write Unit Tests** (AC: 10)
  - [x] Test form pre-population
  - [x] Test update submission
  - [x] Test conflict detection
  - [x] Test photo operations

- [x] **Task 10: Write E2E Test** (AC: 11)
  - [x] Navigate to edit form
  - [x] Change player data
  - [x] Upload new photo
  - [x] Submit and verify changes

## Dev Notes

### Component Reuse
The PlayerFormComponent is reused for both Add (Story 2.3) and Edit (Story 2.4):

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
  if (id) {
    this.isEditMode = true;
    this.loadPlayer(id);
  }
}
```
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md: "Component reusability"]

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
Use `updated_at` timestamp to detect conflicts (last-write-wins):

```typescript
if (serverPlayer.updated_at > localPlayer.updated_at) {
  // Show conflict warning
  this.showConflictDialog(localPlayer, serverPlayer);
}
```
[Source: PRD Epic 2 Story 2.4 AC #8]

### Photo Replacement Logic
When uploading new photo:
1. Upload to same path (overwrites old file automatically)
2. If filename different, delete old file first
3. Update `photo_url` in player record

```typescript
// Overwrite existing photo
await this.supabase.storage
  .from('player-photos')
  .upload(`${teamId}/${playerId}.jpg`, newFile, { upsert: true });
```

### Offline Update Pattern
1. Update IndexedDB immediately (optimistic UI)
2. Add UPDATE operation to sync queue
3. Mark record as `sync_state = 'pending'`
4. When online, process sync queue

## Dev Notes: Testing

### Unit Tests
**File:** `player-form.component.spec.ts`

Additional test cases for edit mode:
- Form pre-populates with player data
- Update submission works correctly
- Photo replacement logic
- Photo deletion logic
- Conflict detection works
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

### E2E Test
**File:** `tests/e2e/player-management.spec.ts`

```typescript
test('should edit player details', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/players/123/edit');
  await page.fill('[name="firstName"]', 'Jane');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/players/123');
  await expect(page.locator('text=Jane')).toBeVisible();
});
```
