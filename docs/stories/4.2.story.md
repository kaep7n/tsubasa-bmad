## Dev Notes

Component location: `/src/app/features/games/pages/game-list/`

Query optimization: Use compound index on (team_id, date) for efficient chronological sorting.

Offline-first pattern: Always load from IndexedDB first, then sync from Supabase in background.

Protected games cannot be deleted via swipe action to prevent accidental data loss.
