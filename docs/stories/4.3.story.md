## Dev Notes

Component location: `/src/app/features/games/pages/game-form/`

Will be reused for edit mode (Story 4.4) by detecting route params.

Default date calculation:
```typescript
const nextSaturday = () => {
  const today = new Date();
  const daysUntilSaturday = (6 - today.getDay() + 7) % 7 || 7;
  return new Date(today.setDate(today.getDate() + daysUntilSaturday));
};
```

Date/time combination:
```typescript
const combinedDate = new Date(`${dateValue}T${timeValue}`);
```
