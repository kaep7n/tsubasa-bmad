## Dev Notes

Component reuse: GameFormComponent handles both create (Story 4.3) and edit (Story 4.4).

Detection:
```typescript
const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
this.isEditMode = !!id;
```

Restrictions:
```typescript
if (game.status === 'in_progress' || game.status === 'completed') {
  this.showWarningDialog();
  // Only allow opponent and location edits
  this.form.get('date')?.disable();
  this.form.get('time')?.disable();
}
```

Calendar sync update:
```typescript
if (game.calendar_sync_id) {
  await this.googleCalendarService.updateEvent(game.calendar_sync_id, gameData);
}
```
