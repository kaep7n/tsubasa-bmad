## Dev Notes

Status-based cancellation (not soft delete) preserves attendance and goals for statistics while marking the game as cancelled.

Protected games have `is_protected = true` when attendance or goals exist, preventing accidental data loss.

Calendar sync update:
```typescript
if (game.calendar_sync_id) {
  await this.googleCalendarService.updateEvent(
    game.calendar_sync_id,
    { summary: `[CANCELLED] ${game.opponent}` }
  );
}
```

Undo pattern:
```typescript
const snackBarRef = this.snackBar.open('Game cancelled', 'Undo', { duration: 5000 });
snackBarRef.onAction().subscribe(() => {
  this.gamesService.uncancelGame(gameId);
});
```
