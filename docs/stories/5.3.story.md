# Story 5.3: Live Scoreboard Header Component

## Status
Ready

## Assigned To
James (Dev Agent)

## Story
**As a** coach,
**I want** to see the current score and game time at all times during live tracking,
**so that** I maintain situational awareness without scrolling

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ `LiveScoreboardComponent` created as sticky header
2. ✅ Displays: team score, opponent score, current minute, half-time status
3. ✅ Positioned as fixed header with z-index above content
4. ✅ Mobile-optimized: compact height (48-56px), thumb-safe zones
5. ✅ Visual states: green pulse (running), yellow (half-time), red (paused)
6. ✅ Tappable timer opens quick-adjust modal
7. ✅ Score increments animate with brief highlight
8. ✅ Component tested in isolation with mock timer service
9. ✅ Accessibility: ARIA live region announces score changes

  - [ ] Horizontal padding: 16px (thumb-safe)

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Fixed Positioning** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] CSS: position: fixed; top: 0; z-index: 100
  - [ ] Full width: width: 100vw
  - [ ] Ensure content below has top padding to prevent overlap

- [ ] **Task 4: Add Visual States** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Running: Green background with pulse animation

  - [ ] ARIA live region: role="status" aria-live="polite"
  - [ ] Announce score changes to screen readers
  - [ ] Semantic HTML: <header>, <time>

- [ ] **Task 8: Write Tests** (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Unit test: Renders correct scores
  - [ ] Unit test: Visual states change with timer state
  - [ ] Unit test: Score animation triggers on change
  - [ ] Mock GameTimerService in tests

## Dev Notes

Component location: `/src/app/features/games/components/live-scoreboard/`

Sticky header pattern ensures scoreboard always visible during scrolling through timeline.

Pulse animation CSS:
```css
@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.8; }
}
.running {
  animation: pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

Score highlight animation:
```typescript
scoreChanged() {
  this.highlightScore = true;
  setTimeout(() => this.highlightScore = false, 200);
}
```

Fixed header z-index must be above FAB (z-index: 100 vs FAB z-index: 90).

Mobile-first design: Large touch targets, high contrast, minimal UI.
