# Story 5.7: Game Timeline & Event History

## Status
Ready for Review

## Assigned To
Claude Code (Dev Agent)

## Story
**As a** coach,
**I want** to see a chronological list of all game events,
**so that** I can review what happened and verify accuracy

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ `GameTimelineComponent` displays scrollable event list below scoreboard
2. ✅ Events displayed chronologically (most recent at top)
3. ✅ Event types: Goals, Opponent Goals, Half-time marker
4. ✅ Each event shows: minute, description, edit/delete icons
5. ✅ Visual styling: team goals (green), opponent goals (red), half-time (gray divider)
6. ✅ Tap event to expand details (scorer, assists, timestamp, notes)
7. ✅ Empty state: "No goals yet - tap the + button to start tracking"
8. ✅ Timeline updates reactively via Signals
9. ✅ Timeline persists scroll position during updates
10. ✅ Accessibility: semantic list markup, screen reader friendly

  - [x] Position below LiveScoreboardComponent
  - [x] Scrollable container

- [x] **Task 2: Load Event Data** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Query goals from IndexedDB (game_id, ORDER BY scored_at_minute DESC)
  - [x] Query opponent_goals from IndexedDB
  - [x] Load goal_assists for each goal
  - [x] Merge and sort chronologically
  - [x] Add half-time marker at 45 minutes

- [x] **Task 3: Build Event List Template** (AC: 4)
  - [x] List item structure:
    - Left: Minute display ("[45]'")
    - Middle: Event description
    - Right: Edit/Delete icon buttons
  - [x] Goals: "Goal by [Player Name]"
  - [x] Goals with assists: "Goal by [Player] (Assists: [Name1], [Name2])"
  - [x] Opponent goals: "Opponent Goal"
  - [x] Half-time: Divider with "HALF TIME" text

- [x] **Task 4: Apply Visual Styling** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Team goals: Green left border accent
  - [x] Opponent goals: Red/amber left border accent
  - [x] Half-time: Gray horizontal divider
  - [x] List item padding: 12px vertical, 16px horizontal

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Event Expansion** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Tap event to toggle expanded state
  - [x] Expanded view shows:
    - Scorer (for goals)
    - Assists (if any)
    - Exact timestamp (HH:mm:ss)
    - Notes (if any)
  - [x] Smooth collapse/expand animation

- [x] **Task 6: Add Empty State** (AC: 7)
  - [x] Show when events array is empty
  - [x] Message: "No goals yet - tap the + button to start tracking"
  - [x] Icon: Soccer ball illustration

- [x] **Task 7: Implement Reactive Updates** (AC: 8)
  - [x] Use Signal for events list
  - [x] Subscribe to goals service changes
  - [x] Update timeline reactively on new goal/edit/delete

- [x] **Task 8: Persist Scroll Position** (AC: 9)
  - [x] Save scroll position before update
  - [x] Restore scroll position after update
  - [x] Prevent jump-to-top on new event

- [x] **Task 9: Add Accessibility** (AC: 10)
  - [x] Semantic HTML: <ul>, <li>
  - [x] ARIA labels for edit/delete buttons
  - [x] Screen reader: Announce event type and details

- [x] **Task 10: Write Tests**
  - [x] Unit test: Event merging and sorting
  - [x] Unit test: Expand/collapse state
  - [x] E2E test: Log goal, verify appears in timeline
  - [x] E2E test: Scroll position persists

## Dev Notes

Component location: `/src/app/features/games/components/game-timeline/`

Timeline is the primary review interface during and after live game tracking.

Event merging logic:
```typescript
const allEvents = [
  ...goals.map(g => ({ type: 'goal', ...g })),
  ...opponentGoals.map(og => ({ type: 'opponent_goal', ...og })),
  { type: 'half_time', scored_at_minute: 45 }
].sort((a, b) => b.scored_at_minute - a.scored_at_minute);
```

Scroll position persistence:
```typescript
@ViewChild('timelineContainer') container!: ElementRef;

updateEvents() {
  const scrollPos = this.container.nativeElement.scrollTop;
  this.events.set(newEvents);
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.container.nativeElement.scrollTop = scrollPos;
  });
}
```

Virtual scrolling consideration: If timeline exceeds 100 events, consider CDK Virtual Scroll for performance.
