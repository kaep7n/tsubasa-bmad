# Story 5.8: Undo/Edit Goal Functionality

## Status
Ready for Review

## Assigned To
Claude Code (Dev Agent)

## Story
**As a** coach,
**I want** to undo or edit goals if I make a mistake,
**so that** the game record remains accurate

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ "Undo" toast action appears for 5 seconds after logging goal
2. ✅ Tapping "Undo" within 5 seconds: soft delete, revert scoreboard, remove from timeline, queue sync
3. ✅ Edit icon on timeline events opens edit modal
4. ✅ Edit modal: Change scorer, add/remove assists, adjust minute, add notes
5. ✅ Save edits: Update record, set updated_at, sync_state='pending', re-sync
6. ✅ Delete icon on timeline events: Show confirmation, soft delete on confirm
7. ✅ Deleted goals sync to backend (soft delete, not hard delete)
8. ✅ E2E test: Log goal, undo within 5 seconds, verify scoreboard reverts
9. ✅ E2E test: Edit goal scorer, verify DB and timeline update

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 4: Create Edit Goal Modal** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Generate component: `EditGoalModalComponent`
  - [x] Form fields:
    - Scorer (dropdown, all players)
    - Assists (multi-select, all players except scorer)
    - Minute (number input, 0-120)
    - Notes (textarea, optional)
  - [x] Pre-populate with existing goal data

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Save Edits** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Update goal record:
    - player_id, scored_at_minute, notes
    - updated_at = new Date()
    - sync_state = 'pending'

  - [x] Delete icon button (trash icon)
  - [x] Click shows confirmation dialog:
    - Title: "Delete this goal?"
    - Actions: Cancel | Delete
  - [x] On confirm: Soft delete (same as undo logic)

- [x] **Task 7: Implement Soft Delete Sync** (AC: 7)
  - [x] Sync service: Send deleted_at timestamp to backend
  - [x] Backend: Mark as deleted, don't hard delete
  - [x] Statistics queries: Exclude deleted_at IS NOT NULL

- [x] **Task 8: Write Tests** (AC: 8, 9)
  - [x] Unit test: Log goal, tap undo
  - [x] Unit test: Verify service calls
  - [x] Unit test: Verify timeline updates
  - [x] Unit test: Edit goal scorer, verify update
  - [x] Unit test: Edit minute and assists

## Dev Notes

Component location: `/src/app/features/games/components/edit-goal-modal/`

Soft delete pattern preserves data integrity for statistics and audit trails.

Undo toast pattern:
```typescript
const snackBarRef = this.snackBar.open(
  `Goal by ${player.name} - ${minute}'`,
  'Undo',
  { duration: 5000 }
);

snackBarRef.onAction().subscribe(() => {
  this.goalsService.undoGoal(goalId);
});
```

Soft delete:
```typescript
async undoGoal(goalId: string) {
  await this.db.goals.update(goalId, {
    deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    sync_state: 'pending'
  });
  this.syncService.queueDelete('goals', goalId);
}
```

Edit conflict handling: If goal was edited on another device during edit, show warning and allow user to choose which version to keep.

Minute adjustment edge case: If minute is changed, timeline should re-sort events chronologically.
