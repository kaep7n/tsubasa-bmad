## Story
**As a** coach,
**I want** to see individual player statistics in a sortable table,

## Acceptance Criteria

2. ✅ Sortable by any column (ascending/descending)
3. ✅ Default sort: Goals Scored (descending)
4. ✅ Mobile-optimized: horizontal scroll, sticky first column, compact spacing
5. ✅ Search/filter: text search, date range filter
6. ✅ Visual indicators: top 3 badges, low attendance warning
7. ✅ Empty state message
8. ✅ Export button: "Export to CSV"
9. ✅ Offline: works from IndexedDB
10. ✅ Accessibility: ARIA sort attributes, keyboard navigation
11. ✅ E2E test: Verify sorting, filtering, CSV export

## Dev Notes

Component location: `/src/app/features/statistics/pages/player-stats/`

Sticky column CSS:
```css
.player-name-column {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 10;
  background: white;
}
```

Top 3 badges logic:
```typescript
getTopPlayers(metric: 'goals' | 'assists'): string[] {
  return this.players
    .sort((a, b) => b[metric] - a[metric])
    .slice(0, 3)
    .map(p => p.playerId);
}
```

Attendance color coding:
```typescript
getAttendanceClass(rate: number): string {
  if (rate >= 70) return 'good';
  if (rate >= 50) return 'warning';
  return 'danger';
}
```
