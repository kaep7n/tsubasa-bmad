## Status
Ready

## Assigned To
James (Dev Agent)

## Story
**As a** coach,
**I want** to see overall team performance metrics,
**so that** I can track progress over the season

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ `TeamStatsComponent` displays summary cards: games, goals for/against, difference, top scorer/assister, attendance
2. ✅ Date range filter: Season, Last Month, Last 3 Months, All Time
3. ✅ Visual charts: goals per game timeline, win rate over time, top 5 scorers
4. ✅ Mobile-optimized: cards stack vertically, charts resize responsively
5. ✅ Offline: all data from IndexedDB
6. ✅ Empty state message
7. ✅ Accessibility: charts have text alternatives, semantic HTML
8. ✅ Unit test: Verify stat calculations
9. ✅ E2E test: Verify charts render and respond to filters

## Dev Notes

Component location: `/src/app/features/statistics/pages/team-stats/`

Chart library: Chart.js via ng2-charts for Angular integration.

Goals per game timeline:
```typescript
const goalsPerGameData = {
  labels: games.map(g => formatDate(g.date)),
  datasets: [{
    label: 'Goals Scored',
    data: games.map(g => g.goals_scored),
    borderColor: 'green'
  }, {
    label: 'Goals Conceded',
    data: games.map(g => g.goals_conceded),
    borderColor: 'red'
  }]
};
```

Win rate chart:
```typescript
const winRateData = {
  labels: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', ...],
  datasets: [
    { label: 'Wins', data: [3, 2, 4, ...], backgroundColor: 'green' },
    { label: 'Draws', data: [1, 1, 0, ...], backgroundColor: 'yellow' },
    { label: 'Losses', data: [0, 1, 1, ...], backgroundColor: 'red' }
