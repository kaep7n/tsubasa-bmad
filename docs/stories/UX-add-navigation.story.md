# Story: Add Navigation Frame to Application

## Status
Ready for Testing

## Assigned To
Sally (UX Expert) / Claude Code (Dev Agent)

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Blocking normal application usage

## Story

**As a** coach using the app,
**I want** a persistent navigation menu to access different sections of the app,
**So that** I can easily navigate between Dashboard, Players, Games, Training, and Statistics without being trapped on a single page.

## Story Context

**Current Situation:**
- After creating a team, users land on the dashboard
- Dashboard only has content and a FAB menu for creating new items
- **NO navigation bar/menu/sidebar exists in the application**
- Users cannot navigate to:
  - Dashboard (if on another page)
  - Players list
  - Games list
  - Training list
  - Statistics
  - Profile/Settings
  - Logout
- Only navigation available is the FAB menu which creates new players/games/training
- Users are essentially trapped on whatever page they land on

**Root Cause:**
- `app.component.html` only has `<router-outlet />` with no navigation frame
- No layout/shell component exists to wrap authenticated routes
- Each feature route loads independently without shared navigation
- Application architecture is missing the navigation layer entirely

**User Impact:**
- **CRITICAL**: Users cannot navigate between application sections after team creation
- Can only access creation forms via FAB menu (players/new, games/new, training/new)
- Cannot view lists, access statistics, or manage profile
- Extremely poor UX - users feel lost and confused

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. ✅ Navigation component displays on all authenticated routes (dashboard, players, games, training, statistics)

2. ✅ Navigation includes links to all main sections:
   - Dashboard (home icon)
   - Players (people icon)
   - Games (sports_soccer icon)
   - Training (fitness_center icon)
   - Statistics (bar_chart icon)
   - Profile/Settings (account_circle icon)

3. ✅ Navigation shows active/selected state for current route

4. ✅ Navigation is responsive:
   - Mobile: Bottom navigation bar (Material Bottom Nav)
   - Desktop: Side drawer or top toolbar (Material Toolbar + Sidenav)

5. ✅ User can logout from navigation menu

6. ✅ Navigation does NOT appear on unauthenticated routes (login, signup, team-setup)

### Technical Requirements

7. ✅ Create `LayoutComponent` with navigation structure

8. ✅ Update `app.routes.ts` to use layout component for authenticated routes

9. ✅ Navigation uses Angular Material components (MatSidenav, MatToolbar, MatBottomNav, MatIcon)

10. ✅ Navigation reflects user's team name/logo

11. ✅ Navigation handles offline state (show indicator if offline)

### UX Requirements

12. ✅ Navigation is intuitive and follows Material Design guidelines

13. ✅ Icons are clear and labeled appropriately

14. ✅ Active route is visually distinct

15. ✅ Navigation animations are smooth (drawer slide, bottom nav transitions)

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create Layout Component

- [x] Generate layout component: `ng generate component shared/components/layout`
- [x] Create navigation structure with:
  - Top toolbar with team name/logo
  - Side drawer (desktop) with navigation links
  - Bottom navigation (mobile) with main sections
  - Content area with `<router-outlet />`
- [x] Add responsive breakpoints for mobile/desktop layouts
- [x] Style using Material Design patterns

### Task 2: Update Route Structure

- [x] Read current `app.routes.ts`
- [x] Create authenticated route group with layout wrapper
- [x] Restructure routes:
  ```typescript
  {
    path: '',
    component: LayoutComponent,
    canActivate: [authGuard],
    children: [
      { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent },
      { path: 'players', loadChildren: ... },
      { path: 'games', loadChildren: ... },
      { path: 'training', loadChildren: ... },
      { path: 'statistics', loadChildren: ... },
    ]
  }
  ```
- [x] Keep unauthenticated routes outside layout (login, signup, team-setup)

### Task 3: Implement Navigation Links

- [x] Add navigation items array with routes, labels, icons
- [x] Implement route highlighting (active link detection)
- [x] Add click handlers for navigation
- [x] Add profile menu with settings/logout

  - All links work correctly
  - Back button behavior is correct
  - Active route highlighting works
- [ ] Test logout functionality from nav menu (requires manual testing)

## Technical Notes

### Recommended Architecture

**Layout Component Structure:**
```
src/app/shared/components/layout/
├── layout.component.ts
├── layout.component.html
├── layout.component.scss
└── layout.component.spec.ts
```

**Layout Template (Simplified):**
```html
<div class="app-layout">
  <!-- Desktop: Top Toolbar -->
  <mat-toolbar color="primary" *ngIf="!isMobile">
    <button mat-icon-button (click)="toggleSidenav()">
      <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>
    </button>
    <img [src]="team?.logo_url" class="team-logo" />
    <span>{{ team?.name }}</span>
    <span class="spacer"></span>
    <button mat-icon-button [matMenuTriggerFor]="profileMenu">
      <mat-icon>account_circle</mat-icon>
    </button>
  </mat-toolbar>

  <!-- Desktop: Side Drawer -->
  <mat-sidenav-container *ngIf="!isMobile">
    <mat-sidenav #sidenav mode="side" opened>
      <mat-nav-list>
        <a mat-list-item routerLink="/dashboard" routerLinkActive="active">
          <mat-icon>home</mat-icon>
          <span>Dashboard</span>
        </a>
        <!-- More nav items -->
      </mat-nav-list>
    </mat-sidenav>

    <mat-sidenav-content>
      <router-outlet />
    </mat-sidenav-content>
  </mat-sidenav-container>

  <!-- Mobile: Bottom Navigation -->
  <div class="mobile-layout" *ngIf="isMobile">
    <div class="content">
      <router-outlet />
    </div>
    <mat-bottom-nav>
      <button mat-tab-link routerLink="/dashboard" routerLinkActive="active">
        <mat-icon>home</mat-icon>
        <span>Dashboard</span>
      </button>
      <!-- More nav items -->
    </mat-bottom-nav>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Navigation Items

```typescript
interface NavItem {
  label: string;
  route: string;
  icon: string;
  mobileVisible: boolean; // Show on bottom nav
}

navItems: NavItem[] = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', route: '/dashboard', icon: 'home', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Players', route: '/players', icon: 'people', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Games', route: '/games', icon: 'sports_soccer', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Training', route: '/training', icon: 'fitness_center', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Statistics', route: '/statistics', icon: 'bar_chart', mobileVisible: true },
];
```

### Material Modules Needed

```typescript
import { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar';
import { MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material/sidenav';
import { MatListModule } from '@angular/material/list';
import { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';
```

### Responsive Breakpoints

Use Angular CDK BreakpointObserver:
```typescript
import { BreakpointObserver, Breakpoints } from '@angular/cdk/layout';

this.breakpointObserver
  .observe([Breakpoints.HandsetPortrait, Breakpoints.TabletPortrait])
  .subscribe(result => {
    this.isMobile = result.matches;
  });
```

Or simple CSS media query approach:
```typescript
@HostListener('window:resize')
onResize() {
  this.isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 768;
}
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Layout component created with navigation structure
- [ ] Routes restructured to use layout for authenticated pages
- [ ] All navigation links work and route correctly
- [ ] Active route is highlighted in navigation
- [ ] Navigation is responsive (mobile bottom nav, desktop side drawer)
- [ ] Team name/logo displayed in navigation
- [ ] Logout functionality works from nav menu
- [ ] No navigation on unauthenticated routes (login, signup, team-setup)
- [ ] User can navigate freely between all sections after team creation
- [ ] Navigation tested on mobile and desktop screen sizes

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Risks:**
- Route restructuring might break existing navigation logic
- Mobile bottom nav might conflict with FAB menu on dashboard
- Nested routing might cause unexpected behavior

**Mitigation:**
- Test all routes thoroughly after restructuring
- Position FAB menu and bottom nav to not overlap
- Use relative routing where appropriate
- Keep route structure simple and clear

**Rollback Plan:**
- Revert route changes if navigation breaks
- Layout component is additive - easy to remove if issues arise

## UX Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Users trapped on single page
- ❌ No way to access main sections
- ❌ Extremely poor user experience
- ❌ App feels broken and incomplete

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Users can freely navigate entire app
- ✅ Clear access to all main sections
- ✅ Intuitive Material Design navigation
- ✅ App feels polished and professional
- ✅ Users understand app structure and can explore features

## Implementation Notes

### Completed Work

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-27

**What was implemented:**
1. ✅ Created `LayoutComponent` with responsive navigation structure
2. ✅ Implemented desktop layout with:
   - Top toolbar with team name/logo
   - Collapsible side drawer with navigation links
   - Material Design styling
3. ✅ Implemented mobile layout with:
   - Top toolbar with team name/logo
   - Bottom navigation bar with 5 main sections
4. ✅ Restructured `app.routes.ts` to wrap authenticated routes with layout
5. ✅ Added navigation items: Dashboard, Players, Games, Training, Statistics
6. ✅ Implemented active route highlighting
7. ✅ Added profile menu with logout functionality
8. ✅ Added offline indicator
9. ✅ Made navigation responsive (768px breakpoint)
10. ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/shared/components/layout/layout.component.ts` (193 lines)
- `src/app/shared/components/layout/layout.component.html` (125 lines)
- `src/app/shared/components/layout/layout.component.scss` (167 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/app.routes.ts` - Added LayoutComponent wrapper for authenticated routes

**Key Features:**
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically switches between desktop (side drawer) and mobile (bottom nav) layouts
- **Active Route Detection**: Current page is highlighted in navigation
- **Team Integration**: Displays team name and logo in toolbar
- **Profile Menu**: Access to profile, settings, and logout
- **Offline Support**: Shows offline indicator when network is unavailable
- **Material Design**: Uses Angular Material components throughout
- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Fixed type narrowing issue with NavigationEnd filter

**Navigation Structure:**
```typescript
navItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', route: '/dashboard', icon: 'home', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Players', route: '/players', icon: 'people', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Games', route: '/games', icon: 'sports_soccer', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Training', route: '/training', icon: 'fitness_center', mobileVisible: true },
  { label: 'Statistics', route: '/statistics', icon: 'bar_chart', mobileVisible: true },
];
```

**Route Structure:**
```typescript
// Authenticated routes wrapped in layout
{
  path: '',
  component: LayoutComponent,
  canActivate: [authGuard],
  children: [
    { path: 'dashboard', ... },
    { path: 'players', ... },
    { path: 'games', ... },
    { path: 'training', ... },
    { path: 'statistics', ... },
  ]
}

// Unauthenticated routes without layout (login, signup, team-setup)
```

### Manual Testing Required

The following items require manual testing in a browser:
- [ ] Navigation flow after team creation
- [ ] All navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Active route highlighting displays correctly
- [ ] Logout functionality works from profile menu
- [ ] Responsive behavior at various screen sizes
- [ ] Mobile bottom navigation positioning vs FAB menu
- [ ] Browser back button behavior
- [ ] Team logo/name display in toolbar
- [ ] Offline indicator appears when network is unavailable

### Known Limitations

1. **Profile/Settings Page**: Currently logs to console - needs implementation
2. **FAB Menu Overlap**: Dashboard FAB menu may need repositioning on mobile to avoid bottom nav overlap
3. **Budget Warnings**: Layout component SCSS exceeds 2KB budget by 249 bytes (non-blocking)

### Next Steps

1. User should test the navigation in browser (`npm start`)
2. Verify all routes are accessible from navigation
3. Check mobile experience (use browser dev tools or physical device)
4. Implement profile/settings page if needed
5. Adjust FAB menu positioning if it overlaps with bottom nav

## Notes

**Why This is Critical:**
- Navigation is fundamental to any application
- Without it, users cannot use the app effectively
- This is likely a result of rapid prototyping where individual features were built without a unified layout
- Should have been implemented from the start, but better late than never

**Design Inspiration:**
- Google Keep (bottom nav on mobile)
- Gmail (side drawer on desktop)
- Google Calendar (combined approach)

**User Testing Notes:**
- After fix, test with real users to ensure navigation is intuitive
- Gather feedback on icon clarity and labeling
- Verify mobile vs desktop experiences are both good

**Related Stories:**
- May need follow-up story for advanced navigation features:
  - Quick search/command palette
  - Breadcrumbs for nested routes
  - Recent items shortcut
  - Keyboard shortcuts
